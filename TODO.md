ðŸš€ TODO: Ghostplane/Ghostbridge + ZVM Native WASM Contract Runtime
1. WASM/ZVM Runtime Integration (Zig Native)

Update/Verify ZVM Runtime:

    Ensure latest ZVM can execute both WASM and ZVM bytecode.

    Test deploy/execute flows for contracts compiled from Zig â†’ WASM and ZVM-native.

    Add missing host functions (e.g. storage, crypto, event emit, gas metering).

    Contract API Exposure:

        Design a ContractRegistry interface in Ghostplane/bridge to deploy, load, and call contracts.

        Enable contract bytecode upload via CLI/API (optionally through gRPC).

        Wire up deployment/execute endpoints in Ghostbridge proto/services.

2. Post-Quantum Crypto Everywhere

Direct Zcrypto/Zsig Integration:

    No FFI to Rustâ€”use zcrypto + zsig for all signing, keygen, and post-quantum operations.

    Ensure host functions in ZVM expose Ed25519, ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and (if needed) BLS/Schnorr.

    Expose keygen, sign, verify, and aggregate APIs to contracts.

    Contract-level Signature Support:

        Multi-sig, threshold, aggregate, and PQ signature verification in ZVM/WASM.

3. QUIC/DoQ/HTTP3 Transport

zquic Integration:

    Confirm zquic provides QUIC, DoQ, HTTP/3 endpoints for contract calls, gRPC, DNS, etc.

    Implement async DoQ/QUIC API for contract and DNS interaction.

    Test with cns/ghostplane/bridge as actual servers, not just demo code.

    Multiplexed Networking:

        Add connection pooling and multiplexing for high-concurrency blockchain workloads.

        Support DNS-over-QUIC and gRPC on same endpoints if desired.

4. Contract Storage and State Management

Integrate zqlite (or pluggable backend):

    Use zqlite for contract persistent storage (state, events, receipts, etc).

    Add contract state root management for rollups/checkpointing.

    State Update APIs:

        Expose storage read/write/delete as host functions in ZVM/WASM.

5. Host/Client Integration and Demos

Contract CLI/JSON-RPC/gRPC Endpoints:

    CLI for deploy, call, query contract state.

    JSON-RPC or gRPC endpoint for contract calls (optionally REST if needed for web).

    Integration Tests:

        Deploy and call test contracts: storage, arithmetic, signature, and rollup demo.

        End-to-end test with Ghostplane, Ghostbridge, and cns stack.

6. Monitoring, Telemetry, and Ops

Prometheus Metrics Export:

    Add per-connection, per-contract, and per-node metrics (latency, errors, throughput).

    Expose as /metrics endpoint or gRPC stream.

    Logging and Error Handling:

        Structured logs for contract execution, networking, and security events.

7. Documentation and Examples

Update READMEs:

    Show how to deploy and call WASM/ZVM contracts in your Zig-native stack.

    Provide real Zig contract example (with crypto and state).

    Architecture Diagram:

        Update to reflect no Rust runtime dependency; clarify ZVM/zcrypto/zquic are canonical.

Optional:

WASM Interop for 3rd party (Rust/AssemblyScript) contracts (if ever needed)

Formal Verification hooks for critical contract logic (phase 2+)

ZK/Threshold/Cross-chain upgrades (future phase)
