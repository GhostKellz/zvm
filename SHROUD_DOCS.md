# üï∏Ô∏è Shroud Framework Documentation

> A high-performance, zero-trust cryptographic and network framework for Ghostchain and the Web5 ecosystem.

---

## Overview

**Shroud v1.0** is a modular framework that bridges **Web2 protocols (DNS, HTTP3, QUIC)** with **Web3 primitives (DIDs, ZNS, QID, cryptographic identity)**. It provides secure, verifiable, high-speed communication over modern internet infrastructure and powers key components of the **Ghostchain** protocol stack.

## Architecture

Shroud follows a modular architecture where each module can be used independently or together as a unified framework. The framework is built in Zig and designed for high performance and security.

### Core Philosophy

- **Zero-Trust**: Every operation requires cryptographic verification
- **Modular**: Each component can be used independently
- **High-Performance**: Optimized for speed and low latency
- **Web5-Ready**: Bridges traditional and decentralized protocols
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: Built with future cryptographic standards in mind

---

## Module Architecture

Shroud consists of 8 core modules organized into three tiers:

### Foundation Tier
- **`ghostcipher`** - Cryptographic primitives and post-quantum crypto
- **`sigil`** - Identity resolution and zero-trust authentication

### Network Tier  
- **`ghostwire`** - Complete networking stack (QUIC, HTTP/1-3, WebSocket, gRPC, IPv6)
- **`zns`** - Decentralized domain name system

### Application Tier
- **`keystone`** - Transaction ledger and state management
- **`shadowcraft`** - Identity enforcement and zero-trust logic
- **`guardian`** - Multi-signature and access control
- **`covenant`** - Smart contract policy engine
- **`gwallet`** - GhostWallet: Secure programmable wallet with RealID integration

## Integration Patterns

### Basic Integration
```zig
const shroud = @import("shroud");

// Use individual modules
const identity = try shroud.sigil.realid_generate_from_passphrase("secure_passphrase");
const signature = try shroud.sigil.realid_sign("data", identity.private_key);

// Networking
var server = try shroud.ghostwire.createUnifiedServer(allocator, config);
try server.start();
```

### Advanced Integration
```zig
// Multi-module integration
const crypto_config = shroud.ghostcipher.zcrypto.CryptoConfig{
    .algorithm = .chacha20_poly1305,
    .key_derivation = .argon2id,
};

const network_config = shroud.ghostwire.unified.UnifiedServerConfig{
    .http1_port = 8080,
    .http2_port = 8443,
    .quic_port = 443,
    .enable_grpc = true,
    .enable_websocket = true,
};

// Create integrated services
var unified_server = try shroud.ghostwire.createUnifiedServer(allocator, network_config);
var ledger = try shroud.keystone.Ledger.init(allocator);
var identity_resolver = try shroud.zns.resolver.UniversalResolver.init(allocator);
