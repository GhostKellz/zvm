### **4. ZVM (Virtual Machine)** ðŸ¤– HIGH PRIORITY
**Current Status:** ðŸ”§ In progress, needs completion  
**ZNS Dependency:** Smart contract execution for advanced domain features

**Required Features for ZNS:**
```zig
// ZVM integration for ZNS smart contracts
pub const ZNSContract = struct {
    pub fn registerDomain(
        vm: *ZVM,
        domain: []const u8,
        owner_pubkey: [32]u8,
        records: []DNSRecord,
        signature: [64]u8,
    ) !ContractResult;
    
    pub fn transferDomain(
        vm: *ZVM,
        domain: []const u8,
        new_owner: [32]u8,
        owner_signature: [64]u8,
    ) !ContractResult;
    
    pub fn setDomainRecords(
        vm: *ZVM,
        domain: []const u8,
        records: []DNSRecord,
        owner_signature: [64]u8,
    ) !ContractResult;
    
    pub fn createSubdomain(
        vm: *ZVM,
        parent_domain: []const u8,
        subdomain: []const u8,
        owner_pubkey: [32]u8,
        parent_signature: [64]u8,
    ) !ContractResult;
};
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Complete ZVM WASM runtime** with gas metering
- [ ] **Create ZNS smart contract interface** for domain operations
- [ ] **Add domain registration contracts** with ownership verification
- [ ] **Implement subdomain delegation** via smart contracts
- [ ] **Add domain marketplace contracts** for trading domains
- [ ] **Integrate with ghostd** for contract execution

**ZNS Impact:** Without ZVM, ZNS cannot support advanced features like programmable domains, marketplaces, or complex ownership models.
