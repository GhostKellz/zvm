## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES - Tonight's Session (v0.3.0)**

### **PRIMARY GOAL: WASM Runtime Integration**
*Target: Complete hybrid ZVM + WASM execution engine*

#### **Phase 1: Core WASM Integration (Tonight)**
- [ ] **WASM Module Loader** - Load and validate WebAssembly modules
- [ ] **WASM Execution Engine** - Execute WASM bytecode with gas metering
- [ ] **WASM ↔ ZVM Bridge** - Seamless interoperability between engines
- [ ] **Unified Contract Interface** - Single API for both ZVM and WASM contracts
- [ ] **Auto-detection** - Automatic bytecode format detection and routing

#### **Implementation Tasks:**
1. **Enhanced WASM Runtime** (`src/wasm.zig`)
   - [ ] Improve existing WASM module loading
   - [ ] Add comprehensive host function bindings
   - [ ] Implement proper gas metering for WASM operations
   - [ ] Add memory management and sandboxing

2. **Hybrid Runtime Architecture** (`src/runtime.zig`)
   - [ ] Create unified contract deployment interface
   - [ ] Add bytecode format auto-detection
   - [ ] Implement cross-engine contract calls
   - [ ] Add shared storage layer

3. **CLI Enhancement** (`src/main.zig`)
   - [ ] Add `zvm wasm <file>` command
   - [ ] Update `zvm hybrid <file>` for auto-detection
   - [ ] Enhance demo with WASM examples

4. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] WASM contract deployment and execution
   - [ ] ZVM ↔ WASM interoperability tests
   - [ ] Performance benchmarking
   - [ ] Gas metering validation

## 📋 **DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Enhanced WASM Module Loading**
```zig
// Target: src/wasm.zig enhancements
- Robust WASM module validation
- Error handling for malformed modules
- Module metadata extraction
- Memory limit enforcement
```

### **Step 2: WASM Execution Engine**
```zig
// Target: WASM runtime with host functions
- Blockchain-specific host functions:
  - get_caller() -> Address
  - get_balance() -> u64
  - storage_load(key) -> u256
  - storage_store(key, value)
  - emit_event(topics, data)
  - call_contract(address, data) -> bytes
- Gas metering for all operations
- Memory sandboxing and limits
```

### **Step 3: Hybrid Runtime Architecture**
```zig
// Target: Unified contract interface
pub const HybridRuntime = struct {
    zvm_runtime: Runtime,
    wasm_runtime: WasmRuntime,
    
    pub fn deployContract(bytecode: []const u8) -> ContractResult
    pub fn callContract(address: Address, data: []const u8) -> CallResult
    pub fn detectFormat(bytecode: []const u8) -> ContractFormat
};
```

### **Step 4: CLI and Testing Integration**
```bash
# New CLI commands
zvm wasm contract.wasm         # Execute WASM contract
zvm hybrid smart_contract.*   # Auto-detect and execute
zvm demo --wasm               # WASM demonstration

# Testing scenarios
- Deploy ZVM contract, call from WASM
- Deploy WASM contract, call from ZVM  
- Gas metering across both engines
- Error handling and edge cases
```
